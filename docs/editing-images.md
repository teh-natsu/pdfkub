# Editing existing images and figures

In **Edit a PDF → Edit text and images**, click a figure to select it. Drag the selected
figure to move it, drag a corner to resize it proportionally, or press Delete to remove
that placement. The context menu also rotates or flips it. Changes support undo and
survive saving/reopening.

PDF figures are not always bitmap images. Imported diagrams often use a **Form XObject**,
which packages text, vector paths, and nested images into one object. PdfKub selects
this object using its `BBox` and optional `Matrix` and edits it as a whole. Its original
content, resources, clipping box, and transparency settings remain intact. Moving or
deleting one use of a shared figure does not alter its other placements or pages.

**Replace Image** and **Save Image As** apply only to raster Image XObjects; these menu
items are disabled for grouped Form artwork. The tool does not ungroup Forms, edit their
individual internal elements, select arbitrary ungrouped vector paths, or edit inline
images (`BI`/`ID`/`EI`). A Form's bounding box may include whitespace.

For automation, `page_images` lists both kinds with `kind: "image"` or `kind: "form"`.
Forms have `pixels: [0, 0]`, since they have no single bitmap resolution. Use the returned
number with `image_edit` (move, rotate, flip_horizontal, flip_vertical, delete).
Coordinates are top-left-origin page points. `image_save` and `image_edit`'s replace action
return a clear error for Form artwork.
