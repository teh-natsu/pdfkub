//! vendor/winit patch (9) (vendor/README.md).

fn winit_sends_a_key_committed_through_macos_ime_only_once() {
    // Apple Korean answers Space with no syllable in progress with `setMarkedText(" ")`,
    // `insertText(" ")` and `setMarkedText("")`. The last call resets winit 0.30.13's IME state, so
    // the key went to the app both as `Ime::Commit(" ")` and as `KeyboardInput` with text " ", and
    // PdfKub's text fields got two spaces. vendor/winit doesn't send `KeyboardInput` for a key
    // whose text was committed, unless AppKit forwards it as a command (Enter) (the goal of
    // rust-windowing/winit#4478). A re-vendored copy without the patch would silently bring the bug
    // back: re-apply the patch, or drop the copy once a winit 0.30 release has the fix.
