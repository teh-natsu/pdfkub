//! vendor/winit patch (5) (vendor/README.md).

fn winit_focuses_the_x11_input_context_it_replaces() {
    // egui allows IME when a text field gains focus and disallows it when the field loses focus.
    // On X11, winit 0.30.13 replaces the window's input context each time and leaves focusing the
    // new one to the next focus event, which never comes while PdfKub's window keeps the focus:
    // the input method doesn't follow the field that has it. vendor/winit focuses the replacement
    // once the queued requests are handled (rust-windowing/winit#4727). A re-vendored copy without
    // the patch would silently bring the bug back: re-apply the patch, or drop the copy once a winit
    // 0.30 release has the fix.
