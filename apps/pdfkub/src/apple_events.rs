//! macOS open-documents and quit Apple events (#73).
//!
//! Finder double-clicks, Open With, drops on the Dock icon and `open -a PdfKub file.pdf` don't
//! pass paths on the command line: LaunchServices sends the running (or just-launched) app a
//! `kAEOpenDocuments` ('odoc') Apple event. winit 0.30 doesn't handle it and owns the
//! `NSApplicationDelegate`, so AppKit answered "PdfKub cannot open files in the PDF document
//! format". Handling it ourselves needs Objective-C class declarations, i.e. `unsafe`, which this
//! workspace forbids. The audited `fmv-macos-events` crate (also used by PhotoCraft) wraps exactly
//! that, an `NSAppleEventManager` handler registered before Finder's launch event that leaves
//! winit's delegate alone, behind a safe main-thread API. This module adapts it to the
//! [`OsEvent`]s that the UI polls every frame.
