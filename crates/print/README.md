# pdfcraft-print

Layer L4: printing (execution plan M10.5).

```rust
let pages = select_pages(count, Some("1-3, ii, 9-"), &labels, Subset::All, false)?;
let settings = Settings { pages, paper: PAPERS[0].1, layout: Layout::multiple(4), ..Default::default() };
let sheets = layout(&display_sizes, &settings)?;   // geometry only (previews)
let pdf = impose(&doc, &settings)?;                // the print-ready PDF
spool::submit(&pdf, &spool::Job { printer: None, copies: 2, ..Default::default() })?;
```

- **Size**: fit (to the sheet minus an 18 pt margin), actual size, shrink oversized, custom %;
  centred; auto orientation turns the sheet for landscape pages.
- **Multiple**: 2/4/6/9/16 (or any n) pages per sheet, horizontal/vertical (reversed) order,
  page borders, auto-rotation of pages that don't match the cell.
- **Cut and stack** (Multiple's page order): consecutive pages in each cell's pile,
  with aligned cut marks in the gutters. For example, 10 pages at 4 per sheet give
  `[1, 4, 7, 10]`, `[2, 5, 8, blank]`, `[3, 6, 9, blank]`. Print single-sided,
  keep sheets in output order, cut at the marks, then stack the cell piles from
  left to right, top to bottom. Blank cells can be discarded. Page ranges and
  Reverse pages are applied before imposition. Duplex imposition is not supported.
  Headless: `doc_print` with `layout: "multiple"`, `order: "cut-stack"` and
  `per_sheet: 4` (or any supported grid size), plus `path` or `printer`.
- **Booklet**: saddle-stitch imposition padded to a multiple of 4; both sides, front or back
  only; left or right binding.
- **Poster**: tile scale, overlap shared by neighbouring tiles, cut marks.
- **Comments & forms**: document, + markups, + stamps, or form fields only; annotations print
  only with their Print flag, drawn from their appearance streams (Algorithm 8.1).

Each source page becomes a Form XObject (its content wrapped in q/Q, plus the printable
annotations); sheets place them with a clip. The result is a fresh, unencrypted,
garbage-collected file (callers check the print permission).

`spool` talks to CUPS: printers come from `lpstat -p -d` (the queues) and `lpstat -e` (driverless
destinations no queue exists for; CUPS builds a temporary one when the job arrives), jobs go to
`lp` with copies, collation, duplex and monochrome options. The job is piped to `lp` on stdin and
never written to a temp file, where another local user could read or swap it. Other platforms
report that printing to a printer isn't available yet; the print-ready PDF can always be saved.

Not yet: Windows and web spoolers, print as image, poster labels, PostScript output, colour
conversion for grayscale.
