# pdfcraft-annot

Comments (annotations), ISO 32000-2 §12.5. Layer L3, depends on `pdfcraft-cos`, `pdfcraft-fonts` and `pdfcraft-model`.

## What it does

- **Builders** for the comment types Acrobat's commenting tools create: sticky note (`Text` +
  `Popup`), highlight, underline, strikethrough, squiggly, rectangle (`Square`), oval (`Circle`),
  line and arrow (`Line` with `/LE`), freehand drawing (`Ink`) and text box (`FreeText`).
- **Appearance streams** (`appearance::build`) generated from the annotation dictionary, so new
  and restyled comments look the same in every viewer. Highlights multiply (`/BM /Multiply`).
  Note icons are PdfKub's own drawings. Text boxes use standard Helvetica (WinAnsi), with
  line breaking by approximate Helvetica proportions (no font program is bundled).
- **Edits:** reply (`/IRT`), set review status (a `/State` reply, as Acrobat's "Set status"
  does), change text, move, resize, restyle, delete (with pop-up and replies).

## API sketch

```rust
let index = add_annotation(&mut doc, &NewAnnotation { page, shape, style, contents, author }, &meta)?;
add_reply(&mut doc, page, index, "Agreed", "Ada", &meta)?;
set_review_state(&mut doc, page, index, ReviewState::Accepted, "Ada", &meta)?;
move_annotation(&mut doc, page, index, dx, dy, &meta)?;
set_style(&mut doc, page, index, Some(rgb), Some(0.5), Some(2.0), &meta)?;
delete_annotation(&mut doc, page, index)?;
signature_image(&doc, page, index)?; // embedded image XObject of Fill & Sign signature/initials
```

A comment is addressed by `(page, index in /Annots)`, the same pair
`pdfcraft_render::Annotation` reports. `Meta` carries the date and the `/NM` id so edits stay
deterministic; the engine supplies them.

## Fidelity rules

- Unknown keys are kept. Inline annotation dictionaries are promoted to indirect objects only
  when an edit needs a reference to them.
- `set_style` refuses (and changes nothing) when it cannot redraw the comment, e.g. stamps,
  cloudy borders or callouts, instead of leaving a stale appearance.
- Replies get the parent's `/Rect` and an empty appearance: they appear in comment lists but
  never paint a second icon.
- Resizing a stamp changes its `/Rect` and preserves its original appearance and resources;
  viewers scale that appearance into the new rectangle. Locked stamps refuse the edit.
- Natural-size image stamps placed by the engine counterrotate their appearance on rotated
  pages. Image restyling retains that appearance matrix. Explicit rectangles, image signatures
  and PDF-page stamps still use their existing placement behavior; page-rotation support for
  those paths is not complete.

## Not yet

Callouts, polygons and polylines, clouds, carets (insert/replace text), stamps, file
attachments, rich text (`/RC`, `/DS`), and the shared named-appearance cache Acrobat writes.
