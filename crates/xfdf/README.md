# pdfcraft-xfdf

Layer L4: comment and form data exchange (execution plan M5.6, M6.7).

```rust
let xml = export_xfdf(&doc, true, true, "form.pdf");   // comments and/or field values
let fdf = export_fdf(&doc, false, true, "form.pdf");
let txt = export_data(&doc, Format::Txt);               // or Xml, Csv
let report = import(&mut doc, &bytes)?;                 // XFDF, FDF, XML, CSV or text, detected
```

- **XFDF** (ISO 19444-1): every comment type PdfKub knows (text, free text, line, square,
  circle, polygon, polyline, markup, stamp, caret, ink, attachments, sound, redact) with rect,
  name, author, subject, dates, flags, colours, opacity, width, icon, quads, line ends, ink,
  default appearance, pop-ups and reply threads (`inreplyto`); field values nested by name.
- **FDF**: fields (with `/Kids` hierarchies) and comments as direct objects.
- **Form data**: Acrobat's XML (`xfdf:original` keeps names that aren't XML names), CSV and
  tab-delimited text (a row of names, a row of values).

Import replaces comments with the same `/NM`, draws appearances PdfKub can draw, and sets
values through the form's own checks (formats, validation, recalculation); read-only fields take
imported values, as in Acrobat. XML is read with `roxmltree`.
