# pdfcraft-create

Layer L4. Create a PDF (Acrobat's Create a PDF tool), execution plan M10.2:

- `blank(width, height, pages)`: an empty document;
- `from_images(&[(name, bytes)])`: one page per image, sized from the image's resolution
  (PNG `pHYs`, JPEG JFIF density; 72 dpi when absent). JPEG data is embedded as is
  (`/DCTDecode`, grey, RGB or Adobe-inverted CMYK); PNG is decoded and stored with Flate,
  with transparency as a soft mask. An ICC profile in the file (JPEG `APP2 ICC_PROFILE`, PNG
  `iCCP`) that matches the image's colour space is kept as an `/ICCBased` colour space with
  the device space as `/Alternate`; images with the same profile share one profile object;
- `from_images_with_resolution(images, ImageResolution::Dpi(dpi))`: override the page
  resolution (1–1200 dpi), without resampling or recompressing image pixels. Use 72 dpi
  for one point per pixel, or `ImageResolution::Embedded` for the same behavior as
  `from_images`. The largest page side is still capped at 14,400 points;
- `from_text(text, …)`: plain text set in Helvetica, wrapped and paginated.

Every function returns a `pdfcraft_cos::Document`; the caller writes it.
