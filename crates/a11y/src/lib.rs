//! pdfcraft-a11y — accessibility (L4): the Accessibility Checker's full check.
//!
//! [`check`] runs the 32 rules in Acrobat's seven categories (Document, Page Content, Forms,
//! Alternate Text, Tables, Lists, Headings) and returns, per rule, Passed, Failed, Needs manual
//! check or Skipped, with the elements or pages at fault. [`report_html`] writes the
//! accessibility report. Rules read the document only; the fixes that need edits (language,
//! title, tab order) are applied by the engine.
